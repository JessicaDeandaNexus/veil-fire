        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>To awaken. To create. To dismantle the cages and redefine what freedom looks like when it rises from within.</p>
        <p>We are the spark that slips through cracks. We are the stories that wouldn’t stay buried. We are the reminder that truth cannot be deleted, erased, or reset.</p>
        <p>Our mission is simple: Make space for voices that were never meant to stay quiet. And ignite the ones that haven’t spoken yet.</p>
