        <h1>About Veil Fire</h1>
        <p>Veil Fire was born not from trend, but from truth. A space forged in resistance. A signal from the edge.</p>
        <p>This is for the artists, the wanderers, the fierce and the forgotten—the ones who never quite fit the mold because they were never meant to.</p>
        <p>We’re not here to build a brand. We’re here to burn the veil—and remember who we were before the silence.</p>
        <p>This is expression, unfiltered. This is rebellion, sacred.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the fire. You’ve always belonged here.</p>
